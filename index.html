      Rejoice in the flavors of Paris, France. These buttery croissants, with
      their impossibly buttery, flaky, tender pastry, practically melt on the
      tongue and are just minutes from freezer to oven as they arrive
      pre-proofed for maximum convenience. Choose from all-butter Plain or
      Chocolate Croissants, filled with exquisite dark chocolate for a breakfast
      or brunch they won't soon forget. So easy - just bake and enjoy. These
      french croissants are one of our best sellers and are the ideal choice at
      any meal. C'est magnifique!
